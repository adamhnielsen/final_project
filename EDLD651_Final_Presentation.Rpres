Overview
========================================================
- Data
- Journey
- Challenges & Failures
- Successes
- Preliminary Findings
- Where we go from here

Journey
======================================================
title: false
left: 60%

![alt text](our_journey.png)
***

- Different starting points
- Varied reasons for learning R
- Learned to backtrack and try again
- Not straightforward! 
- Learned from each other

Exploring Options of Data
==========================
- Narrowed overlapping interests
    - Found numerous data sources (criminology, voting, education)
    - Group poll for interested: selected *differential educational outcomes*
      - Modal interest among options
      - Many variables to leverage


Selected Data
===
- [*NYC OpenData*](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-By-Borough/avir-tzek)
    - Graduation outcome information (2005 - 2010)
    - Variables of interest (SPED Status & EL Status)

Diving into the Data (Aaron & Heidi)
====
Selecting, Filtering & Mutating
```{r select, echo=TRUE, eval = F}

filtered_grad <- clean_grad %>%
  select(c(1:6, 16:22)) %>%
  filter(demographic == "English Language Learners" |
         demographic == "English Proficient Students" |
         demographic == "Special Education" |
         demographic == "General Education") %>% 
  mutate(student_characteristic = 
           factor(demographic, 
                  levels = c("English Language Learners", 
                      "English Proficient Students", 
                      "Special Education", 
                      "General Education"), 
                  labels = c('ELL', 'EP', 'SPED', 'Non-SPED')
                  ))
```

Overcoming Challenges
====
- .DS_store (Aaron)
  - solution: Collaboration!
- GitHub (Chris)
  - solution: Doing what works 
- Presentation through R (Anwesha)
  - solution: Self-teaching & Online Tutorials
- Messy / Poorly Coded Data (Adam & Heidi)
  - solution: attention to detail (& tidyverse)

Anwesha
======================================================

Heidi
======================================================
**Gaining confidence in "R" in general:**
- No prior knowledge of R
- Supplemented tutorials w/apps Enki and Programming Hub for foundational knowledge
- Used "scan" package for anticipated data graphs for dissertation proposal

***

**Successes in this project:**
- Learned from other group members
- Used "select" and "filter"
- Can now use papaja to write APA paper & add citations
- Gained familiarity with Rpres

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
