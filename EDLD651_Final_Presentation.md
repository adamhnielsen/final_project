***

- Different starting points
- Varied reasons for learning R
- Learned to backtrack and try again
- Not straightforward! 
- Learned from each other

Exploring Options of Data
==========================
- Narrowed overlapping interests
    - Found numerous data sources (criminology, voting, education)
    - Group poll for interested: selected *differential educational outcomes*
      - Modal interest among options
      - Many variables to leverage


Selected Data
===
- [*NYC OpenData*](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-By-Borough/avir-tzek)
    - Graduation outcome information (2005 - 2010)
    - Variables of interest (SPED Status & EL Status)

Overcoming Group Challenges
====
- Presentation through R and coordinating
  - solution: email, Zoom, Google docs & searches
- Messy / Poorly Coded Data
  - solution: attention to detail (& tidyverse)


Our Journey with R
======================================================
![alt text](successes.png)



Adam
======================================================
**Challenges**
- Creativity

**Successes**
- Getting the thing started
- Not ruining everything


Aaron
======================================================
**Challenges**
![.DS_Store](ds_store.png)
.DS_Store

***

**Successes**
- Collaboration
- Learning to recover files (after ruining everything)
- Data consolidation

Anwesha
====
**Challenges**
- Rpres
- Merge conflicts

***

**Successes**
- Condensing code
- Collaboration
- Using `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`


Heidi
======================================================
**Challenges**
- Gaining confidence in "R" in general:
- No prior knowledge of R
- Supplemented tutorials w/apps Enki and Programming Hub for foundational knowledge
- Used "scan" package for anticipated data graphs for dissertation proposal

***

**Successes**
- Learned from other group members
- Used "select" and "filter"
- Can now use papaja to write APA paper & add citations
- Gained familiarity with Rpres

Chris
======================================================
**Challenges**
- Utilizing GitHub with Others
- Regular Expression & `pivot_longer()` / `pivot_wider()`
    - I have used these for other projects, but always wasted **lots of time**
    - Previously would pivot one variable at a time and use `left_join()` or analogous

***

**Successes**

- Learning to fork, do pull requests, etc. on GitHub
- Better with `pivot_longer()` & `pivot_wider()`
    - still don't get regular expression though :)

Diving into the Data
====
Selecting, Filtering & Mutating

```r
filtered_grad <- clean_grad %>%
  select(c(1:6, 16:22)) %>%
  filter(demographic == "English Language Learners" |
         demographic == "English Proficient Students" |
         demographic == "Special Education" |
         demographic == "General Education") %>% 
  mutate(student_characteristic = 
           factor(demographic, 
                  levels = c("English Language Learners", 
                      "English Proficient Students", 
                      "Special Education", 
                      "General Education"), 
                  labels = c('ELL', 'EP', 'SPED', 'Non-SPED')
                  ))
```


Mutate, cont'd.
======================================================


```r
new_grad <- filtered_grad %>%
  mutate(unclassified_n = total_cohort - (total_grads_n + dropped_out_n + still_enrolled_n),
         unclassified_percent_of_cohort = round(unclassified_n/total_cohort * 100, 1))
```

Take-aways
===

**EL status**
- Gaps between ELL and EP students appear to display heterogeneity
- certain boroughs (e.g., Staten Island) have much larger gaps between proficiency than others (e.g., Brooklyn)

- From a social justice framework:
    - concerning that Staten Island has the highest graduation % for EP students, and nearly the lowest for ELL students. 
    - redistribution of resources should be considered in such cases

***

**SPED status**
- Gaps between SPED and non-SPED students appear relatively constant across borough
- Some boroughs (i.e., Staten Island & Manhattan) have higher graduation percentages for both groups. 

Next steps
===

**Inferential statistics:** test if differences are significant

**Consult experts & educational theorists:** 
- identify potential confounding variables which explain the variation in these averages (particularly for ELL/EP); e.g.,
    - School-wide access to funding & resources
    - Percent of teachers that speak languages other than English,
    - Predominant non-English language(s) is/are spoken in each borough
    - Average qualification of SPED/ELL teachers
    - Parental access to (and leverage of) extra-curricular educational resources

**Explore redistribution of resources**
